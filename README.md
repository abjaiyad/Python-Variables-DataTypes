# Python – Variables & Data Types  

This repository is part of my **Python learning journey**, where I explore the fundamentals of programming through practical exercises and a mini project. The focus is on **variables and data types**, which form the foundation of Python programming.  

## 📌 Topics Covered  
- Creating and using variables  
- Identifying data types with `type()`  
- Type conversion (int ↔ str, float ↔ int)  
- Working with complex numbers  
- User input handling  
- String operations (first/last character, length)  
- Swapping values without a temporary variable  
- Building a mini project with multiple data types  

## 📝 Exercises Solved  

### Problem 1  
Create variables to store your **name, age, height**, and whether you are a **student (boolean)**. Print each variable with its type.  

### Problem 2  
Convert an **integer** into a **string** and print the result.  

### Problem 3  
Store a **float number** as a variable, then convert it into an **integer**.  

### Problem 4  
Create a **complex number** and print its **real** and **imaginary** parts.  

### Problem 5  
Ask the user for their **name** and **age**, then print:  
Hello <name>, you are <age> years old.

### Problem 6  
Swap the values of two variables **without using a third variable**.  

### Problem 7  
Take a string variable and print its **first character, last character, and length**.  

## 🧩 Mini Project: Student Information Script  

### 🔹 Description  
This script takes student details as input and prints them in a formatted way.  

### Features  
- Accepts **name, age, course, college, and marks** as input  
- Stores them in variables of different data types  
- Displays student information neatly
