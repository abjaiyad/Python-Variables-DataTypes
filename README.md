# Python – Variables & Data Types  

This repository contains beginner-level Python exercises that focus on **understanding variables and data types**. Each exercise is designed to build a strong foundation for programming in Python.  

## 📌 Topics Covered  
- Variable creation and usage  
- Data type identification with `type()`  
- Type conversion (int ↔ str, float ↔ int)  
- Working with complex numbers  
- User input handling  

## 📝 Exercises Solved  

1. Create variables to store your **name, age, height**, and a **boolean (student or not)**. Print each variable along with its type.  
2. Convert an **integer** into a **string** and print the result.  
3. Store a **float number** as a variable, then convert it into an **integer**.  
4. Create a **complex number** and print its **real** and **imaginary** parts.  
5. Write a program that asks the user for their **name** and **age**, then prints:  
   ```
   Hello <name>, you are <age> years old.
   ```
